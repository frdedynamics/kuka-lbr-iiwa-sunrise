203_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the cartesian translational velocity of at least one point of the monitored strucutre of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. In case of a robot arm the monitored points are the centers of the joints and of the flange (robot structure) as well as the centers of the tool spheres (tool structure). In case of a mobile platform the monitored points are the edges of the platform (robot structure) and the centers of the tool spheres (tool structure).
204=Cartesian workspace monitoring

204_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the monitored structure of the monitored kinematic system is not completely within the configured workspace.
205=Cartesian protected space monitoring
205_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the monitored structure of the monitored kinematic system is not completely outside of the configured protected space.
205_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the monitored structure of the monitored kinematic system is not completely outside of the configured protected space.
206=Collision detection
206_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external torque of at least one axis of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
206_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external torque of at least one axis of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
207=Tcp-force monitoring
207_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
207_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. If no tool is attached, the robot flange will be used as reference point.
208=Hand guiding device inactive
208_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is disabled or in panic state.
208_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is disabled or in panic state.
209=Hand guiding device active
209_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is enabled. The AMF monitors the enabling device which is configured for the AMF "Hand guiding device inactive".
209_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the hand guiding device is enabled. The AMF monitors the enabling device which is configured for the AMF "Hand guiding device inactive".
210=Delay
210_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured time is exceeded since the activation of the AMF.
210_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured time is exceeded since the activation of the AMF.
211=Tool orientation
211_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
211_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the tool orientation of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The permitted area is defined by the operating angle and the reference vector in the world coordinate system. The reference vector results from the rotation of the Z unity vector by the ZYX-Eulerangles A, B, C.
212=Tool related velocity component
212_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the cartesian translational velocity of the tool point of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
212_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the cartesian translational velocity of the tool point of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
213=Base related TCP-force component
213_ShortDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured component of the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit.
213_LongDesc=This AMF is violated, if the configured component of the external force exerted on the tool of the monitored kinematic system exceeds the configured limit. The configured component is relative to a reference frame, which results from the rotating the base frame by the ZYX-Eulerangles A, B, C.
